    "Purpose of Constraints in Databases\n",
    "Constraints are rules enforced on the data in a database to maintain data integrity and ensure that the database remains consistent, accurate, and reliable. By restricting the type, range, or relationships of data, constraints help prevent invalid data from being entered and enforce business rules at the database level.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Constraints Help Maintain Data Integrity\n",
    "Prevent Invalid Data\n",
    "Constraints ensure that only data meeting specific criteria is stored in the database. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A NOT NULL constraint ensures critical fields are not left empty.\n",
    "A CHECK constraint enforces specific conditions on a column, such as age >= 18.\n",
    "Ensure Uniqueness\n",
    "Constraints like UNIQUE ensure no duplicate data is inserted where uniqueness is essential, such as in email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish Relationships\n",
    "Foreign key constraints (FOREIGN KEY) maintain relationships between tables and ensure referential integrity by linking records appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automate Business Rules\n",
    "Default values and conditions set by constraints reduce human error and automate compliance with business rules.\n",

    "\"\"\"3  Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify\n",
    "your answer \"\"\"\n",
    "The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that the column cannot contain NULL values. This is useful for fields where the absence of a value would make the data incomplete or meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to Use NOT NULL:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure Data Completeness: Critical fields, like employee names, order IDs, or timestamps, should never be left empty.\n",
    "Support Application Logic: Many business rules require mandatory fields for computations or record identification.\n",
    "Prevent Logical Errors: NULL values can cause issues in queries and calculations. For instance, adding a NULL to a number results in NULL, potentially breaking expected results.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",

    "    age INTEGER\n",
    ");\n",
    "Here, emp_name must always be provided, ensuring each employee record is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?\n",
    "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification:\n",
    "Uniqueness Requirement:\n",
    "A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. A NULL value represents the absence of data and cannot serve as a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT NULL Property:\n",
    "The primary key constraint inherently includes both NOT NULL and UNIQUE. This ensures that each primary key value is distinct and not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational Database Principles:\n",
    "A primary key establishes a unique identifier for a record, which is critical for indexing and relationships (e.g., foreign keys referencing primary keys). Allowing NULL would violate this principle as NULL values cannot be reliably compared or used in relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
